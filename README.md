<h1 align="center">F2 - Command-Line Batch Renaming</h1>

**F2** is a cross-platform command-line tool for batch renaming files and
directories **quickly** and **safely**. Written in Go!

## What does F2 do differently?

Compared to other renaming tools, F2 offers several key advantages:

- **Dry Run by Default**: It defaults to a dry run so that you can review the
  renaming changes before proceeding.

- **Variable Support**: F2 allows you to use file attributes, such as EXIF data
  for images or ID3 tags for audio files, to give you maximum flexibility in
  renaming.

- **Comprehensive Options**: Whether it's simple string replacements or complex
  regular expressions, F2 provides a full range of renaming capabilities.

- **Safety First**: It prioritizes accuracy by ensuring every renaming operation
  is conflict-free and error-proof through rigorous checks.

- **Conflict Resolution**: Each renaming operation is validated before execution
  and detected conflicts can be automatically resolved.

- **High Performance**: F2 is extremely fast and efficient, even when renaming
  thousands of files at once.

- **Undo Functionality**: Any renaming operation can be easily undone to allow
  the easy correction of mistakes.

- **Extensive Documentation**: F2 is well-documented with clear, practical
  examples to help you make the most of its features without confusion.

## ‚ö° Installation

If you're a Go developer, F2 can be installed with `go install` (requires v1.23
or later):
